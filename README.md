Coding along with the book by Will Kurt

[2025 Update]

NOTE 1: I am using Visual Studio Code with a couple plugins that ease things:

1. Haskell - provides the Haskell Language Server (HLS) with lots of IDE features
2. Better Comments Next - provides nice syntax coloring support for various things like TODOs and Notes - I have customized tags for chapter sections ("-- *") and inline execution ("-- >>>")

NOTE 2: Current HLS defaults might give different results that they did a few years ago when formatting the code!

NOTE 3: Files that I revisit today may be updated with inline executions (mentioned above in NOTE 1) which appear as comments beginning with "-- >>>" and which either didn't exist in 2018 or I was unaware of this functionality at that time!
